When this operator is used, Python creates a new object with the updated value and assigns it back to the variable. This operation can be faster than creating a new variable and assigning it to the result of the expression."

This can be especially useful when working with large datasets or when dealing with values that are generated dynamically. Generators also allow for more efficient processing of data, as they can be used to generate only the necessary values, rather than generating a complete list and then filtering or manipulating it. Finally, generators can improve code readability, as they allow for more concise and elegant code, especially when used in conjunction with other Python features such as list comprehensions and functional programming constructs."
