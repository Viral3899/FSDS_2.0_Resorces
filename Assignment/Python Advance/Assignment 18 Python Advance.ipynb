    "     Text files and binary files differ in the way they store data. Text files contain human-readable characters and use a specific encoding format, such as ASCII or UTF-8. On the other hand, binary files store data as a sequence of bytes that do not necessarily represent readable characters. Binary files are used to store non-textual data, such as images, audio, and video files. They are also used to store program executables and other non-human-readable data."

Binary files are a better option when storing non-textual data, such as images, audio, or video files. They are also a better option when storing data that needs to be read or written quickly, such as large datasets or program executable"

    "\n",
    "    When using binary operations to read and write a Python integer directly to disk, issues can arise due to the difference in byte order between different platforms. This is known as endianness. If the endianness of the computer that wrote the integer is different from the endianness of the computer that reads the integer, the value may be read incorrectly. To avoid this issue, the struct package can be used to pack and unpack binary data in a platform-independent way."
