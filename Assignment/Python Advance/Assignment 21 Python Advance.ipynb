    "\n",

    "\n",
    "     True random numbers are generated by natural processes, whereas pseudo-random numbers are generated by a deterministic algorithm. While true random numbers are ideal, they are difficult to generate and often require expensive hardware. Pseudo-random numbers are generated by mathematical algorithms that can produce sequences that approximate true randomness. These sequences are considered \"good enough\" for many applications."
