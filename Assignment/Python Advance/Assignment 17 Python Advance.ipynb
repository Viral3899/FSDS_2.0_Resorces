A greedy pattern matches the longest possible string, while a non-greedy pattern matches the shortest possible string. To transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy pattern, add a \"?\" after the quantifier. For example, changing \".\" to \".?\" makes it non-greedy."

If the pattern is greedy, it matches the longest possible string that satisfies the pattern. If it is non-greedy, it matches the shortest possible string. If you're looking for a non-greedy match but the only one available is greedy, you can modify the pattern to be non-greedy by adding a \"?\" after the quantifier."
