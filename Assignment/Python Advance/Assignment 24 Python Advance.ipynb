    "Q1. Is it permissible to use several import statements to import the same module? What would the goal be? Can you think of a situation where it would be beneficial?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Yes, it is possible to use multiple import statements to import the same module. The goal would be to access different attributes or functions from the module using different import statements. For example, if a module has several functions or attributes, you can import only the ones you need for a particular script using different import statements. This can help keep the code cleaner and improve its readability."

    "\n",
    "    A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements that can be used in other Python programs. One of the characteristics of a module is that it provides a separate namespace, which helps prevent naming conflicts when different modules are used in the same program."

    "\n",
    "    To avoid mutual importing, you can reorganize the code by moving the shared functionality into a separate module that both modules can import. Another way is to delay one of the imports until it is needed by moving the import statement inside a function or class that uses it."

    "\n",
    "    The _ name _ attribute is useful when a module is imported into another module, and you want to determine whether the module is being imported as a library or being run as a standalone program. If the module is being run as a standalone program, the _ name _ attribute will be set to the string '_ main _'. This can be used to conditionally execute code only when the module is run as a program.\n"

    "    Attaching a program counter to an RPN interpreter application can help with debugging and error reporting. It can help identify the exact location in the script where an error occurred, making it easier to diagnose and fix the problem. It can also be used to implement conditional logic and loops in the RPN script."
