In text mode, newline characters are automatically translated to the platform-specific newline character sequence (e.g. '\\r\\n' on Windows), while in binary mode, they are left unchanged. Additionally, in text mode, reading and writing operations return and expect str objects, while in binary mode, they return and expect bytes objects"

    "    The change in string types in Python 3.X can have a significant effect on code that deals with string handling and encoding. Code that relied heavily on the old byte string type (Python 2.X's str type) may need to be modified to use the new Unicode string type (Python 3.X's str type) and handle encoding and decoding explicitly. Additionally, any code that deals with text files or network communication may need to be updated to handle Unicode strings properly. However, Python provides many tools and libraries to make this transition easier, and the benefits of using Unicode strings in terms of better support for non-ASCII characters and more consistent handling of text data make it worthwhile to update your code to use them."
