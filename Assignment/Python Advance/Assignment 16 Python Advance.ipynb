    "\n",
    "    Regular expressions (regex) provide a powerful and flexible means to match, search, and manipulate text data. They allow for pattern matching and string manipulation with a concise and expressive syntax. With regular expressions, you can search and replace specific patterns in text, validate input data, extract specific information from text, and perform more complex text manipulation ta"
