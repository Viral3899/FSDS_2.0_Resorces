    "\n",
    "    Compound interest is the interest that is earned on both the principal amount and the interest that has been previously earned. The benefit of compound interest over a higher rate of interest that does not compound is that it allows for exponential growth of the investment. This means that the interest earned in each period is added to the principal, and then the interest is calculated on the new, higher amount. Over time, this can lead to sig"

    "    A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It consists of a set of rectangles that represent the frequency or proportion of data in a given range or bin. The x-axis represents the range of values being measured, and the y-axis represents the frequency or proportion of data in each range/bin.\n",

    "    The aspect ratio between the X and Y axes can be changed by setting the aspect parameter of the matplotlib.pyplot.axes() function. The aspect parameter takes a string or a number as input, and it specifies the aspect ratio of the plot. If the input is a number, it specifies the ratio of the height to the width of the plot. If the input is a string, it can be one of the following values: 'equal' (equal aspect ratio), 'auto' (automatic aspect ratio), or 'normal' (normal aspect ratio"
