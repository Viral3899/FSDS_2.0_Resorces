    "\n",
    "Operator overloading can be useful in situations where it makes sense to use a particular operator with instances of a class. For example, if you're working with numerical data, it might make sense to define \"add\" and \"sub\" methods so that you can add and subtract instances of your class using the \"+\" and \"-\" operators.\n",

Other commonly used special methods include \"sub\" for subtraction, \"eq\" for equality testing, and \"str\" for string representation."
