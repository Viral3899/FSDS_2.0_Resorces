    "1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. `shutil.copy()` is used to copy a `single` file from one location to another. On the other hand,\n",
    "`shutil.copytree()` is used to copy an entire `directory tree` (i.e., a folder and its contents, including any subdirectories) from one location to another."

    "\n",
    "Ans. The ZipFile method that is equivalent to File objects’ open() method is ZipFile() which is used to create a new ZipFile object. It takes the path to the ZIP file and the mode to open the file in (e.g., 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, 'a' for appending)."
