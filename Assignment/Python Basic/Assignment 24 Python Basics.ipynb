    "    The main difference between def statements and lambda expressions is that def statements are used to create named functions, while lambda expressions are used to create anonymous functions. Def statements are more versatile and can include multiple statements and be called from other parts of the program, while lambda expressions are limited to a single expression and are often used inline as arguments to other functions.\n"

    "    Map, filter, and reduce are three built-in higher-order functions in Python. Map applies a function to each element of a sequence and returns a new sequence with the results. Filter applies a function to each element of a sequence and returns a new sequence with only the elements that pass a given condition. Reduce applies a function to each element of a sequence and aggregates the results into a single value."

They are used to provide additional information to developers and tools that work with Python code, such as linters and type checkers.
