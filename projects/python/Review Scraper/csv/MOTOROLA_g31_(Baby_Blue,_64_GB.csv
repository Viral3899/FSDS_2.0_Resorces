1,"MOTOROLA_g31_(Baby_Blue,_64_GB",Saurav Anuraj,4,Very Good but camera should be improve,Almost Perfect with price Display is best in this segment. But in camera it shows over saturated. Camera quality is ok not the best it could be better. Dynamic range is very bad . Low light is just ok in this segment other phones has better camera quality.Battery is superb almost getting two days of battery life.Overall a good phone with multimedia experience not with the camera.

4,"MOTOROLA_g31_(Baby_Blue,_64_GB",ravi kumar jami,4,Good quality product,"1st, i want  to say thank you to motorola , because they are providing us AMOLED display in this price range.AMOLED + Stock Android is simply Fantastic to use,  no ads and  simple and smooth to use  UI also.  Camera and Processor is not up to the mark.Gamers please don't consider this mobile because not suitable for gaming.But if you guys want to give your mobile  to your dad or mom for daily  use. This is one of the best pick.Anyways thanks motorola for AMOLED and Stock Android"

7,"MOTOROLA_g31_(Baby_Blue,_64_GB",Souvik Ghosh,4,Very Good,"After using more than 1 month, I am writing this review from my Motorola G3. It is a value for money phone for a mid range. Best thing about this phone js it's display in this price range this display is just awesome. Battery backup is roughly upto 1day. Camera is 50MP, but I would say it's average. But it captures good images in portrait mode, ultra wide mode, also in low light condition. Performance is good. I am loving this stock android experience. No ads. There is a little bit fluctuatio..."

Used S21 before this as my primary device, I don't feel much difference regarding display quality between both.Performance seems fine for day to day usage, can play BGMI comfortably at smooth extreme graphics. Battery seems solid too, getting 10-12 hours of SOT with normal usage.. Camera is good for the price, gets the job done. Although if camera is y..."
