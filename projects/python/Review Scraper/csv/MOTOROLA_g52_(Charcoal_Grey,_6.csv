4,"MOTOROLA_g52_(Charcoal_Grey,_6",Debojyoti Kundu,5,Super!,"Good package by motorola. Looks and feels really premium for the price. Display is vivid, speakers are of good quality and performance is good enough for moderate users. The ui optimization seems much better this time as the app opening times and overall animations are smooth even at 60hz. Camera is good in daylight but definitely needs improvement. Stock android experience is refreshing. Battery drain is low so far and call quality is good even in low signal areas. Overall a balanced device ..."
5,"MOTOROLA_g52_(Charcoal_Grey,_6",Kapil Gupta,1,Utterly Disappointed,This phone has major issues. Dual speakers sometimes doesn't work you have to restart phone to make it work again. Phone hangs and re-starts by itself. Internet icon on top shows ( ! ) this error icon and internet doesn't work. You have to turn airplane mode on and off to make internet work again. Phone comes with 2 pre installed apps josh and dailyhunt so it is not clean UI. Camera quality is pathetic. Worst camera in any phone. Call quality is also not the best it's ok ok. Don't waste money...
6,"MOTOROLA_g52_(Charcoal_Grey,_6",Pranab Poira,5,Excellent,I have been using it for 3 days. The phone is definitely good value for money. pOled screen is the best part. The ad free clean UX is the prime reason I chose this over other phones with higher specifications. Battery and camera are satisfactory if not excellent. I was last using Realme3 so it was a big upgrade for me. You can find phones which can outperform in terms of camera and processor. But I am a light to moderate user so this works for me. The white variant looks classy but I guess yo...

Clean UI makes its easier to understand software. Great Display Loud speakers (sound quality is average)Good in-hand feel Camera is fine not the best in this segment. Captured some photos (attached images)Haptic feed is also not the best in this segment. While playing music on speakers I noticed slight vibrations on the rare-side (next to cameras)Overall, I'm happy that I choose moto g52. Hoping for a..."

9,"MOTOROLA_g52_(Charcoal_Grey,_6",Lenin CS,4,Nice product,"Ordered this device in Aug2022 as an exchange with my old phone Redmi9A.Moto G52 is an amazing device with brilliant display. Camera is good. Serves the purpose.it comes with EIS tech for vlogging. Phone is light weight but battery is large with very good Power backup.Android 12 as stock OS is different experience for someone like me who comes from MI phones.I would recommend this phone against Redmi, realme alternatives in this price range."
