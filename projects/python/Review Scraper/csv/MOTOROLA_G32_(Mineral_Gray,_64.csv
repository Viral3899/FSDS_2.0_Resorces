Will update after some days of usage

The display brightness is a bit lower than I expected, at this budget you can easily get amoled displays which are better in terms of brightness.2. The cameras are below average, but I expected it since it's a moto phone, I tried using gcam but couldn't find a good port yet, if I find one in future then..."
