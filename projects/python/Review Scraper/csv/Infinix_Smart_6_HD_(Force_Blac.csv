0,Infinix_Smart_6_HD_(Force_Blac,Malini Desai,4,Worth the money,After using for 3 days my reviews.Can't expect much from this amount. It's made in India.Pros:It has all functionality for daily work.I didn't liked UI so I used Microsoft launcher which is ad free.Camera is good enough not too bad.Big size phone. Android 11Cons:Not for gaming.Display brightness is very low when using in sunlight.
