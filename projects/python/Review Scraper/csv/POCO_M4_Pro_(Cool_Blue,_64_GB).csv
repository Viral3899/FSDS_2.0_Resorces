In my opinion this has 2nd best camera after samsung F23 5g but overall this is best phone considering AMOLED, performance(Great Optimization) and design. Only minus point is software.

7,"POCO_M4_Pro_(Cool_Blue,_64_GB)",Flipkart Customer,5,Super!,"Excellent product. The specs offered at this price range are seriously good. I have been using this for the last 2 months, having a smooth experience with the phone. The highlights (IMO) would be the display and the in-hand feel and design of the device(all other features are also appreciated).
